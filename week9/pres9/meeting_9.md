Today's plan
========================================================
incremental: true

- Lecture:
	+ Data analysis: qualitative and quantitative 


Qualitative information: what is our data?
========================================================
* Text
* Audio or video recording
* Other visual material
* Diary

QDA: discovering patterns
========================================================
* Frequencies
* Magnitudes
* Structures
* Processes
* Causes
* Consequences

QDA: approaches
========================================================
* Case-oriented vs. variable-oriented analysis
* When doing variable-oriented qualitative data analysis, focus on particular characteristics whih are shared across groups, say, gender, age group, education;
* Case-oriented QDA focuses on an in-depth understanding of a particular case. From the theory-generation perspective, one would use _cross-case_ comparison.

QDA: approaches
========================================================
* Grounded theory: deriving theory _inductively_ solely from your data
	+ Comparing incidents which share similar characteristics;
	+ Integrating categories;
	+ Delimiting the theory;
	+ Writing up the theory
* Signs and semiotics

QDA: approaches
========================================================
* Conversation analysis
	+ How the conversation is structured

QDA: analysis
========================================================
* Coding
	+ Coding units (paragraphs, sentences, transcripts)
* How to do coding?
	+ Open coding - try to identify key concepts 
	+ Axial coding - try to aggregate these concepts to a higher-level theoretical concepts
	+ Selective coding  - you are looking for an explicit concept in your text
	
QDA: analysis
========================================================
* Memoing
	+ Code notes - you might want to write up your reflections regarding particular code
	+ Theoretical notes
	+ Operational notes
* Concept mapping
	
Analysis of quantitative data
========================================================
* ODA
