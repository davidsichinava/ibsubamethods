What are focus groups? 
========================================================
* In short, focus groups are _group interviews_ administered by the moderator
* Focus groups as methods emerged after _Columbia University_'s Bureau of Applied Social Research decided to introduce group interviews as a methods
	+ Merton, Lazarsfeld

Why do we use focus groups?

* To gain insights on on _meanings_, _group assessments_, _group processess_, and _normative understandings_ (say, collective judgements)

How and when to use focus groups?
========================================================
* Usually, they are employed as an _adjunct method_ to other methods
* Focus groups also give a good result as a pre-pilot to large surveys
* As an interpretative method, focus groups provide _depth_ to the findings of survey research

How do we select participants to focus groups?
========================================================
* Pre-existing groups vs. purpose-constructed groups
* Size does matter
	+ 6-10 participants, although make sure that it is logistically manageable;
	+ Larger groups often leave participants frustrated as not everyone is able to express his/her views

How do we conduct focus groups? - logistics
========================================================
* Screening and pre-group focus groups
* Audio and video recording

How do we conduct focus groups? - techniques
